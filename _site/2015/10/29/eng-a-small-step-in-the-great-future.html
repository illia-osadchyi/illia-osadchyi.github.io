<p>Evrething what happen in our life - mtivated us. Whether ups or downs. If it was failure then we get an invaluable experience. Or it was fortunate that a sign that we are on the right path. All that we have done we will always have the advantage. It’s no secret that the most valuable thing in ours life is time and health.  Where we are vouch for them as for oneself. We choose to use or spend your time. So turned(it [just] so happens that…) that while studing at the institute time is not mine. So I did spend time. If spending is not in my favor, the health and leaves gonna out the window. Over time, people find a way out of any situation. But to find a solution needs action. But for action need motivation. Well, there is nothing that motivates like a dream.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="bad-language-slanders">Bad language (slanders)</h3>

<p>There will always be people who say, “You’re not good enough… you do not know enough… you’re not smart enough…”.
They say, “It’s not your level, not your way.”. So people, I will say one thing. Keep telling to everyone that I can not, and I’ll show you what I can! They will say, “hey. this is enough for you… or you’re too fast.” And only if you work hard on yourself, only then can one be of great. Hour after hour of hard work will do the trick. It only remains to ask how much you really love your dream. How you belive in it.</p>

<p>All your life they were saying: “You don’t good enough…you don’t know enough…you don’t smart enough…”.
They were say:”You on wrong height, you on wrong way”. They  would tell you know quite foreman very quickly. Keep telling him I CAN’T, and I will show you that I CAN! </p>

<h3 id="i-got-a-dream-and-ill-do-evrething-for-make-it-true">I got a dream and I’ll do evrething for make it true.</h3>

<p>I have a dream and I will do everything to achieve it. If you have a goal, you always know what you need and start to act. Not long ago, I had it. But every day I imagine it all closer to me. This site will help me zapechetlit passed way from a technical point of view. Take the tempo and not to throw momentum. So it is time to draw a line start.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="countdown">Countdown</h3>

<p>To reach the finish line need a good push at the start. And that means you need to prepare yourself.</p>

<p>First steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start reading <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html">“The Swift Programming Language (Swift2.1)”</a>
(on November 1)</li>
  <li>Upgrade to [OS X El Capitan] (http://www.apple.com/osx/elcapitan-preview/)
(on November 2)</li>
  <li>Refresh [Xcode to version 7.1] (https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
(on November 3)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="preparing-for-a-marathon">Preparing for a marathon</h3>

<p>For the runner who has never run a marathon you need to prepare for it for weeks. Composes himself up a plan. Properly assess their strength. And greater emphasis on practice. Therefore, my training will consist of several stages. Such as familiarity with the language <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=29">Swift 2.0. like open-source</a> and Objective-C, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Open source</a> and etc.</p>

<p>Why it need for me?</p>

<p>It’s semply. I will improve my bloging. Where bloging improve my English. Where English improve my understanding meaning of books for programmer. Where the books improve my skill of writing code. Much time of writing code can give me closer to freelance. Freelance will be give me closer to job of my dream.</p>

<p>Why Swift? It’s powerfull and new young language. It’s nice choice for keep up with the times. Swift is the future of iOS Application Development. Also Swift is easy to learn and implement. Swift adopts safe programming patterns and adds modern features to make programming easier, more flexible, and more fun. Swift’s clean slate, backed by the mature and much-loved Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, is an opportunity to reimagine how software development works.</p>

<p>Why GitHub and Open Source? <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/author/matt-weinberger">How Matt Weinberger</a> write in his post, “The idea of “open source” is incredibly important to software developers, because it means that they can understand how the technology works under the hood, down to every line of code, then make their own improvements that they can submit to potentially get included in the main project. It gives a single developer the chance to make a huge impact on a popular piece of software.”. </p>

<p>And it’s true.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="take-a-keen-interest">Take a keen interest!</h3>
<p>So it’s will be my first little steps to the exciting and sometimes frustrating world of iOS development!</p>
